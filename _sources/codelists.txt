Codelists
=========
The **IATI codelists** are key to making IATI activity and organisation data from different publishers **comparable**. 

| Codes are used to represent many standard values in an **IATI activity**. For example, codelists such as :doc:`organisation type </codelists/OrganisationType>` ensure that different publishers have unambiguous, comparable definitions (e.g. 23 = Regional NGO; 60 = Foundation; or 70 = Private Sector) they can use when describing activities.

| Codelists are updated through a :doc:`managed process </codelists-guides/codelist-management>`.  A codelist can either be embedded (centrally managed by IATI) or non-embedded (derived from an authority source).   

| For every codelist, the embedded status, alongside the relevant IATI element(s) are declared and linked to.

| An :doc:`API is also available </codelists-guides/codelist-api>` for accessing codelists.
