<p>The values from this codelist are used to identify the particular list that an organisation identifier was drawn from. The codelist provides a register of known identifier lists, including national company registers, NGO directories and international and multilateral organisation lists - along with guidance and online resources to help locate the identifiers assigned to a specific organisation.</p>
<p>As of 17 July 2017 this list is maintained by the org-id.guide project. Data publishers can now search for and locate the relevant list for a particular organisation identifier using the <a class="reference external" href="http://org-id.guide/">org-id.guide website</a>. The full register of identifier sources is also available to download in <a class="reference external" href="http://org-id.guide/download.xml">XML</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://org-id.guide/download.json">JSON</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://org-id.guide/download.csv">CSV</a> formats.</p>
<p>IATI periodically replicates the codelist of identifier sources from org-id.guide, to assist those accessing IATI documentation. However, it is advised that the most up-to-date source is the <a class="reference external" href="http://org-id.guide/">org-id.guide project</a>.</p>
<p>If org-id.guide does not contain an entry for the kind of organisation you need to identify, you can make a request a new list is included in the register following the <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.org-id.guide/en/latest/contribute/">guidance</a> or by getting in touch with org-id.guide at: <a class="reference external" href="mailto:contact&#37;&#52;&#48;org-id&#46;guide">contact<span>&#64;</span>org-id<span>&#46;</span>guide</a>.</p>

Other EINs may be available by asking the organisation concerned, and are sometimes published on their websites. &#8220;An Employer Identification Number (EIN) is also known as a Federal Tax Identification Number, and is used to identify a business entity. Generally, businesses need an EIN. &#8221; [1] &#8220;An employer identification number (EIN), also called a tax ID number or taxpayer ID, is required for most business entities... A tax ID number is not required if you operate a sole proprietorship or an LLC with no employees, in which case you would simply use your own Social Security Number as a tax ID.&#8221; [2] &#8220;In the US, corporate registration happens at the state level. The timeliness, availability, and licensing of this data varies among all 50 states. There is no federal dataset that contains all corporate registrations. It would be possible to create a unified open registry for all US corporations (even if only via aggregation from state ones) but this does not exist at this time. Across those states performance varies widely and in many cases data is not available in bulk, is not machine readable, is not openly licensed etc. For more detail, see the per state summary on Open Corporates.&#8221; [3] &#8220;The Employer Identification Number (EIN), also known as the Federal Employer Identification Number (FEIN) or the Federal Tax Identification Number, is a unique nine-digit number assigned by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to business entities operating in the United States for the purposes of identification. When the number is used for identification rather than employment tax reporting, it is usually referred to as a Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and when used for the purposes of reporting employment taxes, it is usually referred to as an EIN.
